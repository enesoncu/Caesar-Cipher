# Project Title: Caesar Cipher

## Description
This Python script implements a Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption of messages. It allows you to shift letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions to encode or decode messages.

## Installation
No installation is required. You can simply copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter or save it as a .py file and run it using python your_script.py.

## Usage
**1- Run the Script:** Execute the Python script using a command like python caesar_cipher.py (replace with your actual filename).

**2- Choose Direction:** Select "encode" to encrypt a message or "decode" to decrypt a previously encoded message.

**3- Enter Message:** Type your message in lowercase letters.

**4- Specify Shift:** Enter the number of positions you want to shift the letters (positive for encryption, negative for decryption). The value will be wrapped around the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'z' by 3 becomes 'b').

**5- See Result:** The script will display the encrypted or decrypted message for you.

## Example
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt: encode

Type your message: hello world!

Type the shift number: 3

Here's the encoded result: khoor zruog!

## Contributing
This is a simple script, but feel free to fork the repository and suggest improvements! You can contribute by:
- Adding support for uppercase letters.
- Implementing error handling for invalid user input.
- Enhancing the user interface with additional features.

To contribute, create a pull request on GitHub.

## Additional Notes
This Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique and can be easily broken with brute-force methods. For stronger encryption, consider using more sophisticated algorithms.
